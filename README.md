## ComposeInvestigator

Trace the recomposition of a Composable with its cause without boilerplate code ðŸ˜Ž.

This tool was started for personal learning and has not been proven necessary for production.
However, it can perform the following tasks:

- **Reports if a Composable is skipped during recomposition.**
- **Reports if the arguments of a Composable have changed and been recomposed.** It can also compare the
  values before and after the change.
- **Reports if the state values inside a Composable have been modified.** It can also compare the values
  before and after the change. *(via ComposeInvestigator's runtime plugin)*

---

### Getting Started ![gradle-plugin-version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/in.sungb.composeinvestigator/composeinvestigator-gradle-plugin?style=flat-square)

Just add the plugin to your module-level Gradle like this:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'in.sungb.composeinvestigator' version '<version>'
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ComposeInvestigator is heavily dependent on the Kotlin version. So the version of 
> ComposeInvestigator follows the format `[Kotlin Version - ComposeInvestigator Version]`.

You don't need to use any APIs to get started. But if you're looking for a fancier experience,
consider using the runtime API.

Comprehensive documentation for ComposeInvestigator is available
on [project website](https://jisungbin.github.io/ComposeInvestigator).
